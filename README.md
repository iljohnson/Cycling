The road cycling handicap calculator is written to allow clubs to calculate start times for different groups of riders given different group speeds and race distances. It also allows this calculation to consider a merge point some distance from the distance line. This makes some allowance should estimated group speeds vary from estimates and other matter like having to stop at red flags due to cars are intersections or turning points. The theory is that the groups should merge at a distance from the finish lime and then the combined groups battle out the finish over the last km or so. 

In practice this should favour the stronger groups, however the stronger group speeds vary little from week to week no matter what the prevailing conditions are (wind and group size) whereas lower grades the to vary greatly (+- 2km/hr) depending on group size, wind speed/direction and unknown riders. Hence the greater risk is always with the lower grades.

Much of the output is for general information, however, the Lead times are intended to be used as EntryBoss categories and the Start times as the start times for each category.

The process to follow is:

1 – run the program and it will produce a handicap information table based on the default input parameters. If these are acceptable, click on the “Save Table to file” button to save a copy to your downloads folder.
2 – if the default settings need to be changed, update as required and then click on the “Update Handicap Table” button and this will run through a series of error checks to confirm correctly formatted input has been provided and once confirmed will update the Handicap Table. Review and if acceptable, click on the “Save Table to file” button to save a copy to your downloads folder.
